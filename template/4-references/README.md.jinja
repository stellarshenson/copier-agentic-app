# 4-references

Primary source of examples, rules, and knowledge articles for {{ project_name }}.

This directory defines quality standards, methodologies, and constraints that govern all processing. Agents consult these materials during planning, generation, and verification phases.

## Usage by Phase

**Phase 1 - Analysis**:
- Review rules to understand processing constraints
- Consult examples for output format expectations
- Reference knowledge articles for methodology guidance

**Phase 2 - Framework**:
- Align terminology with rules definitions
- Validate output structure against examples

**Phase 3 - Content Generation**:
- Follow rules during content creation
- Match quality standards from examples
- Apply methodologies from knowledge articles

**Phase 4 - Verification**:
- Execute verification-framework.md protocols
- Compare outputs against examples
- Validate rule compliance

## Content Categories

### Verification Framework
Defines source fidelity requirements, data verification protocols, and compliance criteria. The verification agent executes these protocols before final delivery.

### Examples
Annotated sample outputs demonstrating:
- Expected format and structure
- Quality standards for content
- Appropriate level of detail
- Correct terminology usage

Add examples by creating files in `examples/` subdirectory with annotations explaining what makes each example correct.

### Rules
Processing constraints including:
- Domain-specific requirements
- Prohibited content definitions
- Inference boundaries
- Formatting standards

### Knowledge Articles
Methodology documentation explaining:
- Analytical approaches used in the project
- Theoretical foundations for methods
- Best practices and rationale

## Adding Reference Materials

When adding new reference materials:

1. **Choose correct category**: examples/ for samples, rules/ for constraints, knowledge/ for methodology
2. **Document clearly**: Include purpose, when to consult, and how to apply
3. **Update this index**: Add entry to Contents Index table
4. **Cross-reference**: Link from relevant workflow phases and agent definitions

## Maintenance

- Review for accuracy when project requirements change
- Remove obsolete materials
- Keep examples current with actual output standards
- Update knowledge articles as methodology evolves
