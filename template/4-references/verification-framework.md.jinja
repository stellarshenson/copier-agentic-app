# Verification Framework

## Purpose

This document defines the verification framework to ensure all output documents are based **exclusively** on the source materials in `/1-input/` and maintain quality standards appropriate for {{ target_audience }}.

## Source Materials Profile

### Materials Location
- **Source Directory**: `/1-input/`
- **Type**: {{ input_type }}
- **Note**: Specific material metadata will be documented after initial review

### Key Content Areas
Content areas will be identified and documented after initial source review. Document the main themes, topics, and data categories found in source materials.

## Verification Criteria

### 1. Content Fidelity Checks

#### 1.1 Direct Source Traceability
**Requirement**: Every factual claim, statistic, or concept must be traceable to source materials.

**Verification Steps**:
- [ ] For each section in outputs, identify corresponding source material
- [ ] Verify all data points match source exactly
- [ ] Confirm terminology aligns with source usage
- [ ] Validate all references are accurate

**Red Flags**:
- Data points not present in source materials
- Terms or concepts not mentioned in sources
- Information beyond what sources provide

#### 1.2 No External Information
**Requirement**: Content must not include information from outside source materials.

**Verification Steps**:
- [ ] Check for content not in sources
- [ ] Verify no references to external events or data
- [ ] Ensure no data from other sources
- [ ] Confirm no introduction of external frameworks

**Red Flags**:
- References to materials not in `/1-input/`
- Data or projections beyond source content
- Details not discussed in source materials

#### 1.3 Inference Boundaries
**Requirement**: Reasonable inferences are acceptable but must be clearly distinguished from source facts.

**Acceptable Inferences**:
- Applying general findings to specific context
- Extrapolating implications for target audience
- Connecting source concepts to practical considerations

**Unacceptable Inferences**:
- Specific recommendations not supported by source
- Projections beyond source data
- Requirements not mentioned in source
- Timelines not based on source evidence

### 2. Audience Appropriateness

#### 2.1 Language and Terminology
**Requirement**: Content must be appropriate for {{ target_audience }}.

**Verification Steps**:
- [ ] Technical terms are explained or contextualized
- [ ] Language appropriate for audience level
- [ ] Focus on actionable insights
- [ ] Balance between technical and practical perspectives

#### 2.2 Relevance Filter
**Requirement**: Emphasize content most relevant to target audience needs.

**Verification Steps**:
- [ ] Content prioritized by relevance
- [ ] Key concerns addressed
- [ ] Practical considerations highlighted
- [ ] Audience context maintained

### 3. Structural Integrity

#### 3.1 Internal Consistency
**Requirement**: All outputs must be consistent with each other and with sources.

**Verification Steps**:
- [ ] Data cited consistently across all outputs
- [ ] Terminology used uniformly
- [ ] No contradictions between sections
- [ ] Summaries accurately reflect detailed content

#### 3.2 Completeness
**Requirement**: All required elements present and properly developed.

**Verification Steps**:
- [ ] All planned outputs completed
- [ ] Each output has reasoning documentation
- [ ] All reasoning documents explain source mapping
- [ ] Any assumptions clearly documented

### 4. Forbidden Content

The following content types are **prohibited** as they cannot be verified against source:

- [ ] Information from materials not in `/1-input/`
- [ ] External data sources or references
- [ ] Content beyond source scope
- [ ] Projections not based on source data
- [ ] Details not present in source materials

### 5. Verification Execution Process

#### Phase 1: Initial Content Review (Per Output)
1. Read output completely
2. Create source-mapping document linking each section to source materials
3. Flag any content that cannot be directly sourced
4. Review reasoning document for alignment

#### Phase 2: Data Verification
1. Extract all data points from outputs
2. Verify each against source materials
3. Ensure accuracy of any transformations
4. Check for computational errors

#### Phase 3: Cross-Output Consistency
1. Create terminology index across all outputs
2. Verify consistent use of terms and concepts
3. Check for contradictions or inconsistencies
4. Validate summaries against detailed content

#### Phase 4: Audience Appropriateness Review
1. Review for appropriate language
2. Verify relevance to audience
3. Check for actionable insights
4. Ensure context maintained

#### Phase 5: Prohibited Content Scan
1. Search for external references
2. Check for outside data sources
3. Verify no external information
4. Confirm compliance with constraints

### 6. Verification Reporting

For each output, create verification report containing:

**Section 1: Source Mapping**
- Table linking each output section to source materials

**Section 2: Data Verification**
- List of all data points with source references
- Confirmation of accuracy

**Section 3: Inference Log**
- List of all inferences made
- Justification for each inference
- Confirmation that inference boundaries not exceeded

**Section 4: Issues Found**
- Any content that could not be verified
- Inconsistencies discovered
- Recommendations for revision

**Section 5: Compliance Certification**
- [ ] Content fidelity: PASS/FAIL
- [ ] No external information: PASS/FAIL
- [ ] Audience appropriateness: PASS/FAIL
- [ ] Internal consistency: PASS/FAIL
- [ ] No prohibited content: PASS/FAIL

## Verification Success Criteria

All outputs pass verification if:

1. 100% of factual claims traceable to source
2. 100% of data points match source exactly
3. Zero instances of prohibited content
4. All inferences clearly justified and bounded
5. Complete source mapping documentation exists
6. Cross-output consistency verified
7. Audience appropriateness confirmed
8. All reasoning documents explain source usage

## Final Verification Statement

Upon successful verification, include this statement in VERIFICATION-RESULTS.md:

> "All output documents have been verified against source materials in `/1-input/`. All factual claims, data points, and concepts are traceable to source. No external information has been introduced. Inferences made for {{ target_audience }} context are clearly bounded and justified. The content is appropriate for the target audience."
