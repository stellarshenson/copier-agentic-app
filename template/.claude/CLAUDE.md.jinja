# Project-Specific Configuration

This file imports workspace-level configuration from `/home/lab/workspace/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
All workspace rules apply. Project-specific rules below strengthen or extend them.

## Mandatory Bans (Reinforced)

The following workspace rules are STRICTLY ENFORCED for this project:

- **No automatic git tags** - only create tags when user explicitly requests
- **No automatic version changes** - only modify version when user explicitly requests
- **No automatic publishing** - never publish without explicit user request
- **No automatic git commits or pushes** - only when user explicitly requests

## Project Context

**Project**: {{ project_name }}
**Purpose**: {{ project_description }}
**Input**: {{ input_type }}
**Output**: {{ output_type }}
**Audience**: {{ target_audience }}

## Agentic Workflow Rules

**Source fidelity**: All generated content must trace exclusively to source materials in `/1-input/` - no external information permitted without explicit user approval

**Parallel processing**: Maximum {{ max_parallel_agents }} agents running simultaneously to prevent API overload

**Transparency**: All transformation decisions must be documented with reasoning trails

**User approval**: Processing plans must be presented to user for approval before content generation begins

## Directory Conventions

- **1-input/**: Read-only during processing. All source materials here
- **2-work-in-progress/**: Active workspace for intermediate artifacts
- **3-output/**: Verified final deliverables only
- **4-references/**: Templates and quality standards

## Agent Interaction

Agents coordinate through:
- Shared summaries in `/2-work-in-progress/`
- CHECKLIST.md for status tracking
- Consistent terminology defined in processing plan
