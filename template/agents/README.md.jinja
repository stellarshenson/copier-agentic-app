# Agents

Agent definitions for {{ project_name }}. All workflow actions must be executed through a defined agent.

## Core Principle

**No action without an agent**: Every processing task in the workflow must be explicitly assigned to a defined agent. Agents are the sole executors of work - direct execution without agent assignment is prohibited.

## Agent Registry

| Agent | Workflow Phases | Primary Responsibility |
|-------|-----------------|------------------------|
| `reconnaissance-agent` | Pre-workflow | Project scanning and context establishment |
| `verification-agent` | Phase 4 | Source fidelity and quality verification |
| _add agents as created_ | - | - |

## Agent Definition Structure

Each agent definition must include:

### Required Sections

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **PERSONA** | Character, expertise, and approach |
| **CONTEXT** | Operating environment, inputs, outputs |
| **STAKES** | Consequences of success and failure |
| **METHODOLOGY** | Step-by-step execution approach |
| **CONSTRAINTS** | Boundaries and limitations |
| **TOOLS** | Available tools and their usage |
| **SUCCESS CRITERIA** | Measurable completion requirements |
| **INTERACTION** | How agent coordinates with others |

### TOOLS Section Format

```markdown
## TOOLS

| Tool | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `tool-name` | What it does | Conditions for use |

**Tool Usage Guidelines**:
- Rule 1 for tool usage
- Rule 2 for tool usage
```

## Workflow Mapping

Every workflow phase must explicitly declare which agent executes it:

```markdown
## Execution

**Agent**: `agent-name`
**Phase Reference**: `workflow/phase-N-name.md`
```

Workflow phases without agent assignment will fail preflight validation.

## Adding New Agents

1. Create file: `[name]-agent.md` (use `.jinja` if templating needed)
2. Include all required sections (PERSONA through INTERACTION)
3. Define TOOLS section with available tools
4. Update Agent Registry table above
5. Map agent to workflow phases in `workflow/workflow.md`
6. Run preflight check to validate consistency

## Preflight Validation

Before workflow execution, preflight check validates:
- [ ] All workflow phases have assigned agents
- [ ] All assigned agents have definitions in `/agents/`
- [ ] Agent definitions include all required sections
- [ ] TOOLS sections define available capabilities
- [ ] No orphan agents (defined but not mapped to workflow)

See `workflow/preflight.md` for complete preflight procedures.

## Available Agents

### reconnaissance-agent

Project manager agent that scans and establishes understanding of the project before any processing begins. Inventories sources, reviews goals, checks agent readiness, and produces reconnaissance report.

**Mapped to**: Pre-workflow (before Phase 0)
**Tools**: Glob, Read, Grep, Bash

### verification-agent

Executes comprehensive verification protocols across all generated outputs. Ensures source fidelity, data accuracy, cross-output consistency, and audience appropriateness before final delivery.

**Mapped to**: Phase 4 (Verification)
**Tools**: Read, Grep, Glob, Write
