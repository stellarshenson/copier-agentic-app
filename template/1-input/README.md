Source materials directory.

Place all source materials to be processed in this directory. This directory is treated as **read-only** during processing - source materials should not be modified.

## Organization

Organize source materials in a logical structure:
- Use subdirectories for different material types
- Name files descriptively
- Include metadata files if needed

## Guidelines

- All processing references source materials from this location
- Do not modify sources during processing
- Document any preprocessing applied before placing here
- Keep original formats when possible
