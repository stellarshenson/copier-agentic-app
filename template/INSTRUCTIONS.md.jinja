# Execution Instructions

Entry point for executing the {{ project_name }} project. Consult `GOAL.md` for project objectives and deliverables.

## Prerequisites

Phase 0 must be completed before execution:
- Source materials prepared in `/1-input/`
- Input validated and organized
- Prerequisites verified

## Workflow Overview

The workflow defined in `/workflow/workflow.md`:

**Step 1: Source Understanding**
Read all source materials and create summaries capturing key themes and relevant content. These summaries provide context for all subsequent processing.

**Step 2: Contextual Awareness**
When processing any section, review all other summaries to maintain awareness of entire context. Ensures coherent cross-references and consistent terminology across outputs.

**Step 3: Structure Analysis**
Review source organization to understand hierarchical structure and relationships. Use as guide for content organization and mapping.

**Step 4: Output Structure Design**
Design target structure mapping source materials to output deliverables. Define specific content elements ensuring logical flow and comprehensive coverage.

**Step 5: Processing Plan and Approval**
Create detailed execution plan specifying which sources contribute to each output. Present plan to user for approval before content generation begins.

**Step 6: Parallel Agent Processing**
Generate outputs using separate agents with maximum {{ max_parallel_agents }} running concurrently. Each agent maintains contextual awareness through summaries while processing independently.

**Step 7: Checklist Management**
Create and maintain CHECKLIST.md tracking all items to be processed, current status (pending/in-progress/completed), and processing statistics.

**Step 8: Status Updates**
Agents update status in real-time as work begins and completes, providing visibility into processing progress throughout execution.

Consult `/workflow/workflow.md` for complete workflow definition and `/workflow/README.md` for execution approach.
