# Phase 3: Content Generation

Generate output content using parallel agent processing.

## Objective

Execute content generation according to the approved processing plan, using parallel agents while maintaining quality and consistency.

## Prerequisites

Phase 2 completed with framework established.

## Tasks

### Agent Deployment
- Assign agents to outputs according to plan
- Maximum {{ max_parallel_agents }} agents running simultaneously
- Each agent processes independently with shared context

### Content Generation
- Agents generate content following output structure
- Maintain source traceability throughout
- Create reasoning documentation for all decisions

### Status Tracking
- Update CHECKLIST.md as agents start work
- Mark items complete when finished
- Track processing statistics

### Quality Checks
- Agents perform self-verification during generation
- Flag any issues for review
- Document any deviations from plan

## Outputs

- Generated content in `/2-work-in-progress/`
- Reasoning documentation for each output
- Updated CHECKLIST.md with completion status

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] All outputs generated
- [ ] Reasoning documentation complete
- [ ] CHECKLIST.md shows all items completed
- [ ] Ready for verification phase
