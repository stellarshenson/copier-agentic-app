# Processing Workflow

Core workflow ensuring contextual awareness, parallel processing, and real-time status tracking.

## Overview

This workflow coordinates agent activities across all phases, emphasizing context sharing, controlled parallelism, and transparent progress tracking. The workflow integrates with phase execution to maintain quality and traceability.

## Step 1: Source Understanding

Read and understand all source materials to build comprehensive context.

- Read all source materials in `/1-input/`
- Create working directories in `/2-work-in-progress/`
- Create summary for each source capturing key themes and data points
- Identify content relevant to {{ target_audience }}
- Output: Summaries provide overview context for all subsequent processing

**Phase Reference**: See `phase-1-analysis.md` for detailed execution guidance

## Step 2: Contextual Awareness

Maintain awareness of entire context throughout processing.

- When processing any single section, review summaries of all other sections
- Understand connections and relationships between sources
- Ensures coherent cross-references and consistent terminology across outputs

**Phase Reference**: See `phase-1-analysis.md` for detailed execution guidance

## Step 3: Structure Analysis

Understand source organization and content structure.

- Review source organization and structure
- Understand hierarchical relationships
- Use as guide for content organization and mapping

**Phase Reference**: See `phase-1-analysis.md` for detailed execution guidance

## Step 4: Output Structure Design

Design target structure with source mapping.

- Create prototype structure for outputs
- Map sources to target deliverables
- Define specific content elements from each source
- Ensure logical flow and comprehensive coverage

**Phase Reference**: See `phase-1-analysis.md` for detailed execution guidance

## Step 5: Processing Plan and Approval

Prepare execution plan and obtain user approval.

- Create detailed plan specifying which sources contribute to each output
- Define specific content elements to extract
- Specify order of processing and resource allocation
- **Present plan to user for approval before content generation**
- Do not proceed without explicit approval

**Phase Reference**: See `phase-1-analysis.md` for detailed execution guidance

## Step 6: Parallel Agent Processing

Process outputs using controlled parallelism.

- **Maximum {{ max_parallel_agents }} agents running simultaneously** (to avoid API overload)
- Each output processed independently by separate agents
- When agent completes, it picks up next pending task
- Update CHECKLIST.md status as agents start/complete work
- Agents maintain contextual awareness through summaries (Step 2)

**Phase References**: See phase files for output-specific execution guidance

## Step 7: Checklist Management

Track processing status in real-time.

- Create `CHECKLIST.md` file with processing status tracking
- Include list of all items to be processed
- Track current status of each item (pending/in-progress/completed)
- Record processing statistics
- Update throughout processing for visibility into progress

## Step 8: Status Updates

Maintain real-time status information.

- Agent changes status to "in progress" when starting work
- Agent marks item as "completed" when finished
- Update CHECKLIST.md immediately upon status changes
- Provides real-time visibility into processing progress

## Workflow Integration with Phases

This workflow integrates with detailed phase execution documents. Consult individual phase files for complete task lists, outputs, and completion criteria.

- **Phase 0**: Preprocessing and preparation
- **Phase 1**: Analysis (Steps 1-5)
- **Phase 2**: Framework setup before content generation
- **Phases 3+**: Content generation (Step 6 with Steps 7-8 for tracking)
- **Verification Phase**: Quality verification
- **Final Phase**: Finalization and delivery

## Key Principles

**Contextual awareness**: Step 2 ensures agents understand full context when processing any section

**Controlled parallelism**: Step 6 limits concurrent agents to prevent API overload while maximizing throughput

**Transparency**: Steps 7-8 provide real-time visibility into processing state

**User approval**: Step 5 ensures alignment before significant processing begins
