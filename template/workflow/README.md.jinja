# workflow

Processing instructions and execution procedures for {{ project_name }}.

## Execution Model

**Agent-driven execution**: All workflow actions are executed through defined agents. No direct execution without agent assignment.

**Preflight required**: Before starting any workflow phase, execute preflight check (`preflight.md`) to validate project configuration.

## Contents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `preflight.md` | Pre-execution validation - run before workflow |
| `workflow.md` | Main workflow coordinating all phases |
| `phase-0-preprocessing.md` | Source preparation |
| `phase-1-analysis.md` | Source analysis and planning |
| `phase-2-framework.md` | Framework setup |
| `phase-3-content-generation.md` | Parallel content generation |
| `phase-4-verification.md` | Quality verification |
| `phase-5-finalization.md` | Final delivery |

## Phase-Agent Mapping

Every phase must declare its executing agent:

| Phase | Agent | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Phase 0 | _TBD_ | Define agent |
| Phase 1 | _TBD_ | Define agent |
| Phase 2 | _TBD_ | Define agent |
| Phase 3 | _TBD_ | Define agent |
| Phase 4 | `verification-agent` | Defined |
| Phase 5 | _TBD_ | Define agent |

**Requirement**: Update this mapping after defining agents for each phase.

## Execution Sequence

1. **Preflight**: Run `preflight.md` checks - abort if any fail
2. **Phase 0**: Preprocessing (prepare sources)
3. **Phase 1**: Analysis (understand sources, design outputs)
4. **Phase 2**: Framework (establish processing standards)
5. **Phase 3**: Content Generation (parallel agent processing, max {{ max_parallel_agents }} concurrent)
6. **Phase 4**: Verification (quality and source fidelity checks)
7. **Phase 5**: Finalization (deliver verified outputs)

## Invoking Execution

```
Execute Preflight Check
```

Then, for each phase:
```
Execute Phase [N]: [Phase Name]
```

Example:
```
Execute Phase 1: Analysis
```

## Integration Points

- **Agents**: `/agents/` - Consult agent definitions for execution details
- **References**: `/4-references/` - Quality standards and verification framework
- **Scripts**: `/src/` - Supporting automation tools

## Quality Control

- Agents update `CHECKLIST.md` as work progresses
- Verification agent validates all outputs before finalization
- Processing plan requires user approval (Phase 1, Step 5)
