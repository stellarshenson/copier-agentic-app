# workflow

Processing instructions and execution procedures for {{ project_name }}. This directory contains the core workflow and detailed phase execution files that coordinate all processing activities.

**Contents**:
- `workflow.md` - Main workflow coordinating contextual awareness and parallel processing
- `phase-0-preprocessing.md` through `phase-N-finalization.md` - Detailed execution guidance for each phase
- Phase files define objectives, tasks, outputs, and completion criteria for each stage

The workflow integrates with agent definitions (`/agents/`) and quality standards (`/4-references/`) to ensure systematic processing with comprehensive verification. Processing phases can execute in parallel using up to {{ max_parallel_agents }} concurrent agents while maintaining quality control.
