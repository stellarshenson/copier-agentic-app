# Phase 1: Preparation and Source Analysis

Analyze source materials, create summaries, and design output structure.

## Objective

Build comprehensive understanding of source content and design target structure. This phase establishes context that ensures coherence across all subsequent processing.

## Prerequisites

Phase 0 completed (source materials available in `/1-input/`)

## Tasks

### Step 1: Source Understanding
- Read and analyze all source materials
- Create summary for each source capturing key themes and data points
- Extract metadata (titles, dates, types)
- Identify content relevant to {{ target_audience }}

### Step 2: Cross-Source Context
- Review all summaries to understand full context
- Identify connections and relationships between sources
- Document how sources relate to project goals

### Step 3: Structure Analysis
- Review source organization
- Understand hierarchical structure and content organization
- Identify which sources are most relevant for each output

### Step 4: Output Structure Design
- Design structure for outputs
- Map each source to target output(s)
- Define specific content elements from each source

### Step 5: Processing Plan
- Create detailed execution plan showing which sources contribute to each output
- Define specific content elements to extract from each source
- Specify order of processing and resource allocation
- **Present plan to user for approval before proceeding**

## Outputs

- `/2-work-in-progress/source-summaries.md` - Summary of each source
- `/2-work-in-progress/source-analysis.md` - Comprehensive analysis
- `/2-work-in-progress/output-structure.md` - Designed output structure
- `/2-work-in-progress/processing-plan.md` - Detailed execution plan
- `/2-work-in-progress/CHECKLIST.md` - Processing checklist (initialized)

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] All sources read and summarized
- [ ] Source analysis document created
- [ ] Output structure designed with source-to-target mapping
