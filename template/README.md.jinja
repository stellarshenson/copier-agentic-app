## Quick Start

1. Run `/init-project` to capture goals, context, and workflow configuration
2. Run `/self-check` to validate project consistency
3. Run `/process` to execute the workflow

**Project goal**: See `GOAL.md` for objectives and deliverables
**Execution**: See `INSTRUCTIONS.md` for workflow entry point

## What It Does

This project processes {{ input_type }} and produces {{ output_type }} for {{ target_audience }}. Content generation follows a multi-phase workflow ensuring contextual awareness, parallel agent processing, and comprehensive quality verification.

## How It Works

Source materials in `1-input/` are analyzed and processed through defined workflow phases. Agents operate in parallel (max {{ max_parallel_agents }} concurrent) to generate output with reasoning documentation. All output undergoes verification before final delivery.

## Commands

- `/init-project` - Capture goals, context, and workflow configuration
- `/process` - Execute full workflow (preflight -> assessment -> phases)
- `/self-check` - Validate consistency across goals, workflow, and agents

## Directories

- **1-input** - Source materials (read-only during processing)
- **2-work-in-progress** - Active processing workspace
- **3-output** - Verified final deliverables
- **4-references** - Reference materials, rules, examples, and knowledge articles
- **agents** - Agent definition files
- **doc** - Project documentation
- **src** - Scripts and reusable tools
- **workflow** - Workflow definitions and execution procedures
