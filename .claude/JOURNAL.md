# Claude Code Journal

This journal tracks substantive work on documents, diagrams, and documentation content.

---

1. **Task - Project initialization**: Initialized copier-agentic-app template project with Claude Code configuration<br>
   **Result**: Created `.claude/CLAUDE.md` importing workspace configuration with project-specific context for Copier template management. Created `.claude/JOURNAL.md` for session tracking. Initialized git repository with `.gitignore` and initial commit.

2. **Task - Copier template creation**: Created full Copier template from example-agentic-project reference<br>
   **Result**: Studied example project structure to understand agentic workflow patterns. Created `copier.yaml` with 8 template variables (project_name, project_description, goal_summary, input_type, output_type, target_audience, max_parallel_agents, author_name). Built `template/` directory with complete structure: `.claude/` configuration, numbered directories (1-input through 3-output), 4-references with verification framework, agents with verification-agent definition, workflow with 6 phase files (phase-0 through phase-5) and main workflow.md, plus src and doc directories. All relevant files use `.jinja` extension with Jinja2 variable placeholders. Removed example-agentic-project after extraction. Updated main README.md with usage instructions and generated structure documentation. Committed as `1931e8f`.

3. **Task - Template enhancements**: Implemented patterns from CHANGES-HANDOVER.md review<br>
   **Result**: Simplified `copier.yaml` by removing `project_slug` and `author_name` variables (now 7 variables). Added `template/2-work-in-progress/CHECKLIST.md.jinja` for progress tracking with phase-based structure and statistics section. Added `template/2-work-in-progress/terminologia.md.jinja` for terminology standardization with tables for source terms, domain terms, abbreviations, and translation notes. Restructured `verification-agent.md.jinja` using PERSONA/CONTEXT/STAKES/METHODOLOGY/CONSTRAINTS format for clearer agent definition. Updated READMEs to reflect new artifacts. Committed as `f0f6b93`.

4. **Task - Strengthen src and 4-references**: Enhanced directory roles based on patterns from invoice-processing, henryk-trips, report_data_tables_processing<br>
   **Result**: Replaced `template/src/README.md` with `README.md.jinja` containing module index table, script requirements (CLI, logging, error handling, progress reporting), usage patterns with example commands, and development guidelines. Replaced `template/4-references/README.md` with `README.md.jinja` establishing it as primary source of examples, rules, and knowledge articles with contents index, usage-by-phase guidance, and content categories. Added subdirectories `examples/`, `rules/`, `knowledge/` with .gitkeep files explaining purpose of each category. Committed as `08deaa2`.

5. **Task - Agent-driven execution and preflight**: Strengthened agent role with mandatory workflow mapping, TOOLS sections, and preflight validation<br>
   **Result**: Replaced `template/agents/README.md` with `README.md.jinja` establishing "no action without agent" principle, agent registry with workflow mapping, required sections (PERSONA through INTERACTION including TOOLS). Enhanced `verification-agent.md.jinja` with comprehensive TOOLS section listing Read/Grep/Glob/Write tools plus Python script templates with code generation pattern. Created `template/workflow/preflight.md.jinja` with 7-category validation checklist (input, directories, agent definitions, workflow-agent consistency, references, tools, goal clarity) including abort conditions and resolution procedures. Updated `workflow/README.md.jinja` with execution model requiring preflight and phase-agent mapping table. Created three template commands: `/init-project` for capturing project goals and context, `/process` for executing workflow (preflight first, then reconnaissance, then phases), `/self-check` for consistency validation across goals/instructions/workflow/agents. Created `reconnaissance-agent.md.jinja` with project manager persona responsible for scanning project and establishing context before processing. Committed as `4fb6ab4`.

6. **Task - Control flow diagram and refinements**: Added mermaid control flow diagram to INSTRUCTIONS.md and renamed reconnaissance agent to project manager<br>
   **Result**: Added mermaid flowchart to `INSTRUCTIONS.md.jinja` showing complete control flow from `/process` command through preflight validation, project manager assessment, phases 0-5, to completion with artifact references and abort conditions. Renamed `reconnaissance-agent.md.jinja` to `project-manager-agent.md.jinja` and updated all references (agents README, INSTRUCTIONS diagram, process command). Output artifact renamed from `RECONNAISSANCE-REPORT.md` to `PROJECT-ASSESSMENT.md`. Added Quick Start sections to both main `README.md` and template `README.md.jinja` with commands overview. Converted template variables from table to bullet points in main README.
